COP 3404
Project 3

Purpose:

	Creating pass one of the assembler. Pass one generates the proper addresses for each line.

General Description:
		Compile: make
		Execute: ./p3 filename
		
		filename = user entered txt file.
 
		Reads in a text file with an expectation of all CAPITAL letters, NO TABS only spaces,
                and the following fixed format:
			
			Col 1-8    label optional
			Col 9      blank
			Col 10     + optional
			Col 11-17  mneumonic
			Col 18     blank
			Col 19     #, @, =  ... optional
			Col 20-29  (operand) label, register, ',',X optional  ...
			Col 30-31  blank
			Col 32-80  comments optional (NO PERIOD REQUIRED)
		

		
		Reads each line into any ArrayList<StringInfo> were the string is parsed
		and disected to know what the string entails.
		Index expectation for the line: 
						Label = 0 - 7
						Mneumonic = 10 - 16
						Operand = 19 - 28
						Comment = 31 - 79

		StringInfo also takes care of the Memory Size in Bytes.

		Addressing class generates the proper address for each line. Also hashes
		all the labels with there associated address. 

		OperandInfo class: Run after the address and hashing to know more about
				   the operand and to check if the label exists.
